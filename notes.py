# 9/28
    # Got through all planned material
    # i.e. tech em intro, what is coding/program, hardware vs. software,
    # out-of-seat programming activity, efficiency, how comps manage
    # info with 0 and 1, binary number system, explain lightbot, lightbot,
    # discuss recognizing patterns and break problems down
        # make binary number flash cards more lively
        # make a bigger deal about patterns and decomposing problems

# 10/5
    # Quick Review
    # impromptu lecture: more binary and logic gates/circuits
        # 1 = on = yes = True = open
        # 0 = off = no = False = closed
            # impromptu classroom door lesson: closed door is the gate, once 1 is reached, eletricity flows through causes something to happen vice versa.
            # impormptu relate logic gates to switches in the brain, neurons --> fight or flight
                # think of our brains as containing all the programs, tells body what to do
    # design thinking discussion --> chair designer, fav games and why
    # design thinking questions --> hyperpad, 3 games, 4 minutes each
    # discussed good level design, started sketches of designs on paper
