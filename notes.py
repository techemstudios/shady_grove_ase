# 9/28
    # Got through all planned material
    # i.e. tech em intro, what is coding/program, hardware vs. software,
    # out-of-seat programming activity, efficiency, how comps manage
    # info with 0 and 1, binary number system, explain lightbot, lightbot,
    # discuss recognizing patterns and break problems down
        # make binary number flash cards more lively
        # make a bigger deal about patterns and decomposing problems

# 10/5
    # Quick Review
    # impromptu lecture: more binary and logic gates/circuits
        # 1 = on = yes = True = open
        # 0 = off = no = False = closed
            # impromptu classroom door lesson: closed door is the gate, once 1 is reached, eletricity flows through causes something to happen vice versa.
            # impormptu relate logic gates to switches in the brain, neurons --> fight or flight
                # think of our brains as containing all the programs, tells body what to do
    # design thinking discussion --> chair designer, fav games and why
    # design thinking questions --> hyperpad, 3 games, 4 minutes each
    # discussed good level design, started sketches of designs on paper

# 10/12
    # 5min final touches to level-design sketches
    # review design thinking thoughts we thought about (I think)
    # Hyperpad intro
        # the layout
        # background walkthrough
        # stressed the importancance of recognizing everything is an object
        # we can duplicate similar objects
        # as a class: set a block's behaviors to a simple patrol pattern (x, y)
        # as a class: control character movements (only joystick controlled/jump w/ button)

# 10/19
    # fine-tuned character movements
    # set up interactions between player and environment i.e. obstacles, collectibles, etc.
